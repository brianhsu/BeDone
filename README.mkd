BeDone GTD Web App
====================

BeDone is a TODO management web application that follows the [Getting Things Done][01] approach. You may checked out what it looks like at http://bedone.twbbs.org.tw:8081/

Since this is just a personal project, so there are still losts of problem. Specifically, the performance of Next Action tab is really terrible. 

It's based on Scala / Lift Webframework.
